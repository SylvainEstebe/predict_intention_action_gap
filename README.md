# Data Science Project - Inequality and Childcare

This repository holds the code for the final project for Data Science (S2024). This includes data preprocessing, model fitting, and result plotting.

Due to privacy restrictions, the data is not publicly available; therefore, the full pipeline cannot be run without providing the data. However, the code is provided for reference to show the steps taken to preprocess the data and train the models.Access may be granted upon request, with joined consent from the authors.

## Usage and Reproducibility

The code was developed and tested on a MacBook Pro with macOS (Sonoma 14.4.1, python v3.11.7).

## Instructions

### Setting Up the Environment

1. **Install required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the setup script:**
